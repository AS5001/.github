This AS5001 GitHub organization (`AS5001`) contains materials for The University of St Andrews & SUPA module on Advanced Data Analysis.

It is designed as a public, upstream resource to house 
* course description
* module syllabus
* grading rubric
* lecture PDFs
* public starter project repos 

and will be updated to track the current semester.

Note that some aspects of course administration require privacy, so the following features are available in semester-specific, students-only organizations (e.g., `AS5001-2024`):
* *private* starter project repos, copied from the public ones in source (`AS5001`). This allows student repositories to remain private from the world and one another.
* GitHub Classroom collects semester projects into one organization.
* GitHub Discussions collects semester topics.
